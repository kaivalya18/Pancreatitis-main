# Pancreatic Cancer Prediction AI

## Overview
This project builds a Streamlit-based frontend for an AI model that predicts pancreatic cancer likelihood.

## Project Structure
- `model/`: Contains the trained AI model (`.ipynb` and `.pkl` files).
- `frontend/`: Streamlit UI and helper functions.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies list.

## Installation & Execution
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```sh
   streamlit run frontend/app.py
   ```

## Features
✅ User-friendly input fields  
✅ Real-time AI predictions  
✅ Professional UI with dynamic elements  
✅ Data preview for analysis

## Future Improvements
- Add data visualization
- Deploy on cloud platforms
- Improve model interpretability
